\# Customer Churn Prediction – ABT Case Analysis



🎓 MBA Project | 📅 May 2024 | 🏫 University Canada West



This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using historical customer data. Conducted as part of the course \*Predictive Analysis: What Works?\*, the objective is to simulate a real-world business analytics problem where churn is predicted using a structured \*\*Analytical Base Table (ABT)\*\*.

\## 🧠 Problem Statement



In the banking industry, customer churn (i.e., when a customer discontinues their relationship) represents a major threat to profitability. Using demographic, transactional, and product usage data, this project explores:



\- How to detect patterns of churn

\- How to build a binary classification model using Python

\- How to handle missing and flawed data

\- How to design an effective ABT to support prediction



---



\## 🛠 Tools \& Techniques



\- \*\*Python\*\* (Pandas, Matplotlib)

\- \*\*Microsoft Excel\*\*

\- \*\*Descriptive Statistics\*\*

\- \*\*Missing Value Handling\*\* (Missing Indicator, Imputation)

\- \*\*Analytical Base Table (ABT) Design\*\*

\- \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\*

\- \*\*Git \& GitHub\*\*

\## 📊 Key Insights



\- Highest missing data was in \*\*Credit Score (17%)\*\*

\- Age and Salary fields contained unrealistic or flawed entries (min age = 4, max age = 335)

\- \*\*France\*\* had the highest churn customer base based on Geography frequency analysis

\- Derived statistical thresholds (IQR, mean, min/max) used to filter or flag anomalies

\- Missing indicators and imputation suggested to improve predictive model accuracy
